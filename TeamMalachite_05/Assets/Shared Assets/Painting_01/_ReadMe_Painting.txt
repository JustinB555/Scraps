You can use the PictureFrame01_Picture mesh to display any image you want.
Get any picture off the internet, then bring it in to a phot editing program
Rotate the picture so that it is 90 degrees clockwise and resize it to 1024x1024
It's ok if the picute is poorly scaled, this will be fixed when is applied to the mesh.
Next, bring the image into Unity and place it in the diffuse field of the painting material.
If you want a canvas look, leave the normal map, but if you want a smooth look, change the material to be diffuse
